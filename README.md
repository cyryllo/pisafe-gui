# PiSafe GUI 🫐

A graphical interface (PyQt5) for the [pisafe](https://github.com/RichardMidnight/pi-safe) tool — an easy way to flash system images onto SD/USB drives and create backups of them, without using the terminal.

## ✨ Features

- **⚡ Flash image → SD/USB** — pick an image file (`.img`, `.zip`, `.xz`, `.gz`, `.zst`) and a target drive, flash it in one click
- **💾 Backup SD/USB → image** — create backups of SD cards with your choice of compression format
- **🛡️ System disk protection** — the app automatically detects and **hides** disks where the system is mounted (`/`, `/boot`, `/home`, etc.), so there's no risk of accidentally overwriting your own system
- **📋 Disk list** — full overview of connected block devices (`lsblk`)
- **📜 Real-time logs** — full command output visible inside the app
- **🎨 Dark theme** — interface styled after Catppuccin Mocha

---

## 🌐 Languages

The interface is available in:

- 🇬🇧 English (default)
- 🇵🇱 Polski

Switch language from the dropdown in the app's header — the app restarts to apply the change. Translations live in [`translations.py`](translations.py) as plain key → text dictionaries, so adding a new language doesn't require touching any UI code. Want to add yours? See [Contributing](#-contributing) below.

## 🖥️ Requirements

- Linux / Raspberry Pi OS
- Python 3.7+
- [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
- [pisafe](https://github.com/RichardMidnight/pi-safe) (the underlying tool, installed automatically by `install.sh`)

---

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyryllo/pisafe-gui.git
cd pisafe-gui
bash install.sh
```

The `install.sh` script:

1. Installs `python3-pyqt5` and `pv`
2. Installs the `pisafe` tool if it's not already present on the system
3. Creates an application shortcut in the system menu

---

## ▶️ Running the app

From the system menu: System > PiSafe GUI

From the terminal:

```bash
python3 pisafe_gui.py
```

> Flash/backup operations require `sudo` privileges, since `pisafe` operates directly on block devices. The app will prompt for a password when running the command.

## ⚠️ Known limitations

- The progress bar doesn't show a real-time percentage — this depends on whether `pisafe`/`dd` outputs progress data to stdout. Currently the bar jumps from 0% to 100% once the operation finishes.

---

## 🗺️ Planned features (TODO)

- [ ] Real progress bar (e.g. via `pv` or by monitoring output file size)
- [ ] Image checksum verification (MD5/SHA256)
- [ ] History of recent operations
- [ ] System notification when a task finishes
- [ ] Support for multiple disks at once
- [ ] Image version management — browse a chosen folder of created images and tag/version each backup (e.g. v1, v2, "stable"), so it's easy to tell older and newest images apart

## 🤝 Contributing

Pull requests and issues are welcome! If you find a bug or have a feature idea, please open an issue in this repository.

**Adding a translation:** open [`translations.py`](translations.py), add your language code and name to `LANGUAGES`, then copy the `"en"` dictionary under a new key and translate the values (keep the `{placeholders}` as they are). That's it — no other code changes needed. PRs for new languages are very welcome!
